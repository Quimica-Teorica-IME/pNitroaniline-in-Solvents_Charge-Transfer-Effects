In this repository, you will find the singlet ground state (S0) geometries of solvated para-nitroaniline (pNA). Eight solvents (cyclohexane, toluene, acetic acid, dichloroethane, acetone, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, and water) of different polarities were examined. 

S0 optimizations were carried out employing CAM-B3LYP//def2-TZVPD using the Gaussian09 program. The Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM) was employed to include solvent effects in the geometry optimization. By using the optimized geometries, ten vertical singlet excited states were computed using the ADC(2)//def2-TZVPD implemented in the Turbomole v6.6 program. The Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) continuum model with the state-specific approach was used to implicity include solvent effects on the excited states. These data were also included.

It also contains two Excel files respectively with the NTO and CT parameters (TheoDORE_solvents.xlsx) and the spectral data, both theoretical and experimental (Spectra_solvents.xlsx) of the aforementioned systems.

We hope our work will help you in any way possible and feel free to contact us.

From the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we wish you all the best.
